This app allows you to create circadian lighting zones within your home.

As the sun moves through the day, it'll calculate color temperature percentages that you can use within flows to dynamically control lighting.
Using apps like Hue you can set a temperature percentage, or even adopt color themes on accent lights at different day stages.

Circadian also supports a "Night" mode, that'll set lights to a fixed temperature and brightness. Integrate with Sleep and Security states to change the way bedroom and hallway lighting reacts to family members moving about at night.
